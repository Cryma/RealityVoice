# RealityVoice [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j13w2gt9rwfcfqxs/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Cryma/realityvoice/branch/master)

RealityVoice is an open-source 3D voice chat for GTA 5 ([Grand Theft Multiplayer](https://gt-mp.net/)), based on OpenAL and Lidgren.

**Important:** This application is not for daily use, there are many bugs and it is quite network-heavy. The good thing is: It can be fixed. This application is for developers who want to integrate it in their own launcher - not for end-users.

Nevertheless, it would be nice if there will be an active contribution as it would greatly improve the stability.
